 Notes: 
 
 More useful error messages should indicate in which field the error occurred
 
 Phone number input should probably strip dashes and have a minimum size of 10, or require dashes and have a 
     minimum size of 12--unclear as to why 11 is the minimum length (maybe country code?)
 
 There were a few potential issues with the UI: When selecting a length of stay on the calendar, the bar showing the length of stay does not seem to match the legnth
     stay set by the user. For example, if I were to drag my mouse from 4/15 to 4/16 (one night) the bar would cover 4/15 - 4/17, though it would display "1 night"
 It is not immediately obvious how a user selects dates for their stay. The easiest solution for this would be to add helper text indicating that the user should
     drag their mouse over the desired dates
 I noticed inconsistencies with the way the error messages were displayed during manual testing: with bad input, repeatedly
     clicking submit caused the order of the error messages to change
 
 Given more time, tests would include bad input, particularly database commands to make sure input is sanitized and a user cannot bypass the UI to change the
     internal state of the application
 
 Please note that in the time allotted for this test I did not have a chance to address these bullet point:
        - Ability to navigate through a calendar to see available dates for booking
     I would have verified this using Cypress and made sure that the bar showing the length of the reservation matches the desired length of stay. That said, this
     test would have failed as there does not seem to be any indication of which dates are already booked vs. which ones are free.
